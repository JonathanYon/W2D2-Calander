        - a different style for days that has some planned meetings
        -- FUNCTIONS
        - knowing how many days we have in the selected month
        - create how many day-boxes we need to show in our calendar according to the previous function
        --- ensure that when we create the 'today' box it will be styled differently
        - knowing the current month
        - move the the prev/next month
        - create a new meeting
        --- collect input from the user
        --- organise those inputs into a meaningful entity ('meeting')
        --- display the new meeting info in the meetings list
        --- it should store this entity somewhere to be able to show the list of meetings again 
            when I click on this same day again
        - display selected day's meetings
        - select the day I want to interact with (to view meetings or add more) 
        - display proper month/year
